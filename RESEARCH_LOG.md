### Techniques in top records that we DON'T have

| Technique | In # records | Have it? |
|---|---|---|
| **Parallel Residuals** | 1437, 1420, 1425 | ❌ → **PATCHED THIS FIRE (Patch 13)** |
| **Depth Recurrence** | 1421, 1422, 1429, 1435, 1437 | ❌ (LESSONS.md §29 wrongly marked DEAD) |
| **SP-8192 tokenizer** | 1437, 1423, 1431 | ❌ (planned but not built) |
| **MuonEq-R optimizer** | 1423, 1429 | ❌ |
| **Pre-Quant TTT** | 1423, 1430 | ❌ |
| **N-gram "Tilt"** | 1437, 1430, 1420 | ❌ (different from our additive bias?) |

| **SwiGLU MLP** | 1428 | ❌ (we use relu²) |
| **Codebooks (VQ)** | 1433 | ❌ |
| **Int4-Packed MLP** | 1429 | ❌ |

### LESSONS.md §29 needs reconsideration

LESSONS.md claims "ANY recursion is DEAD under GPTQ quantization (~900x compounding error per 3 cycles)". But **5 of the top 10 recent records use depth recurrence**:
- PR #1421, #1422, #1429, #1435, #1437 — all RECORDS (not non-records)

The "depth recurrence is dead" finding was from 2026 mid/early experiments and may have been beaten by better quantization (mixed precision INT5/INT6 instead of pure GPTQ int6) or by different recurrence patterns (3-layer recurrence vs MoR-style 1-layer × 3).

**Action**: do NOT skip depth recurrence in future experiments. Worth a Patch.

### Action taken this fire

**Implemented Patch 13: USE_PARALLEL_RESIDUALS=1** (4 lines net change to Block.forward).

Anchors on the first 3 lines of Block.forward (def + mix + resid blend) which are invariant under Patch 11 (smear gate). Inserts a parallel branch above the existing serial path. When the env var is set:

```python
attn_in = self.attn_norm(x)
mlp_in = self.mlp_norm(x)
attn_out = self.attn(attn_in)
mlp_out = self.mlp(mlp_in)
x = x + self.attn_scale * attn_out + self.mlp_scale * mlp_out
return x
```

This is the GPT-J / PaLM trick, validated in 3 of the top recent records.

### Experiments queued in this fire

| name | new flag |
|---|---|
| `PR0_parallel_resid_alone` | USE_PARALLEL_RESIDUALS=1 (no other novel) |
| `PR1_parallel_plus_leaky_ng` | + LEAKY_RELU + full ngram |
| `PR2_parallel_plus_full_stack` | + smear + leaky + full ngram |

### Next research fires should investigate

1. **N-gram "Tilt"** — what is it? Different from additive bias. Could be Q-R skip-bigram from RESEARCH.md §31, or a multiplicative scaling, or a learned transformation.
2. **Depth recurrence** with mixed-precision quant (the version that's NOT dead)
3. **MuonEq-R** variant of the Muon optimizer
4. **PartialRoPE + FA3** combo
